Operating Unit in Purchase Requisitions
=======================================
This module was written to extend the Purchase Requsition capabilities of Odoo.

This module introduces the operating unit to the purchase requisition.

Security rules are defined to ensure that users can only display the
Purchase Requisitions in which they are allowed access to.

Installation
============

No additional installation instructions are required.


Configuration
=============

This module does not require any additional configuration.

Usage
=====

At the time when a user creates a new purchase requisition the system
proposes the user's default operating unit.

The operating unit is a required field.

When the user creates a purchase order (PO) from the purchase requisition the
operating unit is copied to the PO.
